Community Interest Tracker
----------------------

Below is the title and reaction count for issues filed in all Algorand-owned repositories. Issues labeled with the "community interest" label will appear on this list. Anybody is welcome to add this label to an issue, and express their preference or disagreement with an issue by reacting with :+1: or :-1:.

This tracker is used to gauge community interest in different features or improvements. A high interest count (many :+1:) does not guarantee the issue will be worked on since there are many other factors that go into that decision, but these counts serve as input to prioritization decisions.
